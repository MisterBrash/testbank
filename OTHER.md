# Markup
## Something I should learn

It's pretty *awesome*

You can __bold__ things and also *emphasize* them.

Insert `code` and other things.

But I'n not quite sure how to bold ***and*** emphasize. Oh, I guess that's it.

Also, linking to a site is confusing.

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")
